Getting and cleaning data (Project)
===================================
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
Submitted: 
1) a tidy data set as described below,
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

run_analysis.R
