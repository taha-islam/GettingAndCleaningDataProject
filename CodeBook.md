R code analysing: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0)
==================================================================
This code generates a tidy data set with the average of some variables extracted from the original dataset for each activity (1:6) and each subject (1:30)

30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
For each record it is provided:

The output includes the average of:

mean(): Mean value, and
std(): Standard deviation

of the following variables:
